# FeyndDiagram
A C++ program to find all Feynman diagrams for a user-defined model and process.

**This program is still in development - features may change with no notice and no assurances are made for functionality.**
## Features
* Flexible and open-ended model definition
* Fast algorithm for tree-level diagram generation
## Features in development
* Generation of loop diagrams at all orders
## Future functionality
* Evaluation of diagrams
* Automatic model generation
## Usage
Before compiling and running, define a valid particle model in *UserModel.h*, providing particle names, an antiparticle dictionary and a list of allowable interactions of the theory.
